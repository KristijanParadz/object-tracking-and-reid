# Multi-Camera Object Tracking and Re-Identification

This repository contains the code developed as part of my **Master‚Äôs degree project**.  
It implements **object tracking and re-identification across multiple cameras** using **YOLO** for detection and **ResNet-50** for feature extraction.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Multi-camera **object tracking** and **re-identification**  
- **YOLO** for detection  
- **ResNet-50** for feature embedding  
- **CUDA** support (if available)  
- **Dockerized setup** for easy deployment  
- **FastAPI** backend with a **Vue.js** frontend  
- Backend and frontend communicate using **Socket.IO**  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- **Linux** (project is configured for Linux usage)  
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed  

Before running the system, make sure to review and configure:  
- [`config.py`](./backend/frame_processing/config.py)  
- [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml)  

---

## üê≥ Running with Docker
To start the system, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will spin up the FastAPI backend and Vue frontend.

## üé• Camera Calibration

Before starting the algorithm, you must **calibrate your cameras**.  
The system relies on calibration data to correctly perform multi-camera tracking.

If you only want to **see how the system works without real calibration**, you can insert fake calibration data into your browser‚Äôs `localStorage`.

Example data (add manually in your browser‚Äôs developer console):

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("calibrationData", JSON.stringify([
